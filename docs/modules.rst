**autopent.py**: is the tool's main entry point

**wlan.py**: this module contains attacks that can be executed against wireless networks

**helpers.py**: this module contains essential methods and functions to help the flow of the tool in general

**structures.py**: this module contains two classes *Target* and *Client* to modelize and organize collected data about APs and their attached clients.

And this is actually an auto-generated list of modules:
